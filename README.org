* puppet-tor

a very simple module to install tor on debian from the tor project
repos.  supports hidden services and non exit relays which is what I
need on the projects I use it.
* example hiera
tor::tor_relay: false
tor::hidden_service: true
tor::hidden_service_name: "foo"
tor::hidden_service_ports:
  - "22"
  - "3030"
